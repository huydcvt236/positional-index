After days of waiting the beautiful duckâ€™s eggs hatched. Six tiny ducklings were born, not as beautiful as their mother and not as average as their father. The six ducklings were not good looking at all. The mother duck knew her ducklings will not get far with their looks and hoped they got her intelligent mind.")
